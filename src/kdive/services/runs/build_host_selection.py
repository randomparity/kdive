"""Build-host selection and capacity admission for the ``runs.build`` tool boundary.

Resolves a :class:`~kdive.profiles.build.ServerBuildProfile`'s ``build_host`` name to a
live :class:`~kdive.db.build_hosts.BuildHost` row, validates it is available and
compatible with the profile's kernel-source provenance, and acquires one capacity lease
under the ``BUILD_HOST`` advisory lock so the lease and the subsequent ``BUILD`` job
enqueue commit atomically.

The caller must already hold an open transaction and the ``RUN`` advisory lock; this
function takes the ``BUILD_HOST`` lock inside that transaction (``RUN → BUILD_HOST`` in
the global lock order).
