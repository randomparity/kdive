# Validate records under a profile-selected directory.
#
# This engine is record-kind-agnostic: it knows nothing about docs/debt/ or docs/adr/ on
# its own. A profile (see profiles/, selected by RECORD_PROFILES) supplies that knowledge —
# which directory holds the records, their required sections, and their status rules — and
# the engine enforces the properties every record kind shares, the ones prose cannot
# enforce:
#
#   1. every record carries the fields that make it auditable, with content
#      under each of them, and
#   2. no record stops being a record — not by deletion, not by rename, not by moving
#      into a subdirectory, and not by being replaced with a symlink.
#
# Records are immutable in the same sense as an ADR: resolution is a banner added to
# the record, never a deletion. Every disappearance is therefore an error.
#
# A checker that silently passes is worse than no checker, so every degraded path here
# is fatal rather than skipped: a bad base ref, an unreadable tree, the wrong working
# directory, a symlinked record or container, or a base ref that held records when the
# tree now holds none. The one deliberate exception is an unset BASE_SHA outside CI,
# which downgrades to record validation only and says so — and which is itself fatal
# inside CI.
#
# What it cannot do: this gate lives inside the tree it gates. It detects its own
# *deletion* (see gate_paths and GATE_PREDECESSORS), but a PR may still edit this file, and
# a PR that removes the workflow removes the job rather than failing it. Only a required
# status check plus human review closes that. See ADR 0007 and docs/debt/0003.
#
# Dates are compared as integers with the dashes stripped, so no `date -d` and no locale
# collation is involved. There are no arrays and no associative arrays either: bash 3.2 is
# the macOS system shell, where `"${arr[@]}"` on an empty array is fatal under `set -u`,
# so every list travels as newline-delimited text.
#
# Tested by check-records-test.sh beside it — every rule below has a case there, and the
# suite's acceptance criterion is that neutralising any single rule turns it red.
#
# Layout-independent: the paths it protects are derived, not hardcoded, so it behaves the
# same whether it sits in .github/scripts/ (a repo that adopted it) or in the publishing
# repo's skill assets.

# Old<TAB>new, one mapping per line, populated by the PR that renames a gate file and pruned by
# the PR that follows. An entry with no slash is a sibling basename resolved against SELF_DIR,
# which keeps a same-directory rename layout-independent — an adopter's scripts live at
# .github/scripts/, so a repo-path mapping would be wrong for them. An entry with a slash is a
# repo-relative path, which is the only way to express a rename that moved directories: the old
# path is not under the new SELF_DIR at all. A path-form entry is inert everywhere else, since
# check_gate_files only consults the mapping for a path the base ref actually has.
#
# A stale entry is inert for *exemption*, but the registry is not otherwise inert and must not
# be emptied. gate_known_basenames draws the gate-existence witness set from both sides of
# every entry, so the entries here are what let this gate recognise the name it had at a base
# ref that predates a rename. Empty the list and an undeclared rename of the script stops
# being E-GATE-EMPTY-SET and becomes I-GATE-BOOTSTRAP at exit 0 — a false green on the exact
# vector that rule exists to catch, reproduced by renamed_gate, renamed_no_workflow,
# renamed_moved_dir and renamed_gate_workflow_collision, all four of which go red if this
# string is emptied.
#
# That is the shape docs/debt/0006's non-regression boundary forbids making more reachable:
# both witnesses depend on the gate having been named something this registry knows, and a
# prune removes the only name it knows besides the running script's own. Prune an individual
# entry only with the suite green afterwards.
#
# A predecessor is by definition present at the base ref and absent from the tree, which is the
# E-GATE-GONE condition — so a bare list would trade one red for another. Exemption is granted
# only where the named successor exists as a tracked, non-symlink regular file. That proves a
# file exists there, not that it is the gate; it narrows the door rather than verifying the
# redirection.
