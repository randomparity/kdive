# Bring a merged record's markers into the current form, mechanically.
#
# Run locally, never in CI. Dry-run by default; --write applies. It requires a clean
# worktree, touches only files under the active profile's RECORD_DIR, and never commits —
# the result is meant to land as one reviewable commit that a human wrote the message for.
#
# Every transform is **line-local**. It rewrites markers and the case around text without
# moving text between lines or regions, and without introducing text the line did not carry:
#
#   # 1. Title, # ADR 1: Title    ->  # 0001 — Title   (number from the filename)
#   ## Status:, ## status         ->  ## Status
#   accepted (2026-07-19)         ->  Accepted (2026-07-19)          (case only)
#   accepted 2026-07-19           ->  Accepted (2026-07-19)          (case and parentheses)
#   - target: path, "  review-by:" ->  target: path, review-by:      (at column one)
#
# It will not invent content. A bare ACCEPTED with no date is reported, not dated: the date
# is not on the line, and the only other source is a separate metadata line, which lifting
# would be a relocation. A missing or empty section is reported for human authoring, never
# stubbed — a placeholder trades a warning for an E-SECTION-EMPTY error. A malformed
# resolution banner is reported rather than guessed, because the canonical form needs a date
# that is not derivable from the text.
#
# It will not relocate content either. A pre-template record that keeps its status as a
# metadata bullet above the first heading keeps it: turning that into a section moves a line
# from outside every section into a new one. Such a record has its title fixed and nothing
# else, and stays grandfathered afterwards.
#
# Provenance is the commit, not a label in the record. A `migrated:` line would be new
# content, would make the non-marker comparison differ, and would fire E-REWRITE — a tool
# promising markers-only cannot add content to announce itself. The summary prints the
# `Migrated-markers:` trailer lines to put on the commit instead.
#
# Not copied into an adopting repo: the five gate assets are, this is run from the skill.
