# Regression tests for check-records.sh.
#
# The checker is the only mechanically enforced constraint behind ADR 0007, so its
# failure mode is the dangerous one: reporting a clean run over nothing. Every rule it
# claims has a case here, and every case asserts the exit status rather than the output,
# because a green exit is exactly what an erasure attempt is trying to obtain.
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repo under a scratch directory, runs the real
# checker against it, and compares the exit status to the expectation. Nothing here
# touches the repository it lives in.
#
# Usage: check-records-test.sh [scratch-dir]
#
# A run builds roughly seven thousand files, and the scratch tree it created is removed when
# every case passes. A red or aborted run keeps it, because those fixtures are the only record
# of what failed. An explicitly supplied scratch-dir is the caller's and is never removed.
#
# Needs bash, git, and POSIX find/sed/awk/grep/sort/uniq/diff/mktemp/date — nothing else.
# No perl, no Python, no GNU-only flags, no bash-4 constructs: an adopter's gate must not go
# red for a missing interpreter. It resolves the workflow template from either the
# publishing layout (beside the scripts) or the adopted one (../workflows/).

  # A rename must still be caught even when the repo's own workflow happens to sit at the
  # literal path one of GATE_PREDECESSORS' own path-form entries names
  # (.github/workflows/debt.yml — the exact filename the adoption table has told every
  # adopter to create). That literal path must never be checked directly regardless of
  # this repo: gate_paths's predecessor loop excludes any .github/workflows/* key for
  # exactly this reason. Without the exclusion, this fixture's own untouched debt.yml —
  # wholly unrelated to the undeclared script rename below — would keep the protected set
  # non-empty and mask it, turning E-GATE-EMPTY-SET into a silent pass. Deliberately not
  # named records.yml, unlike every other fixture in this suite: the collision this case
  # exists to catch is specifically with the literal old name.
