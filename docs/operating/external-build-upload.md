# Preparing artifacts for the build lane

**This is the build lane (ADR-0234): build locally, upload, `runs.complete_build`.**
No operator-staged source tree or build host is needed.

The build lane ingests a kernel you built yourself: `runs.create` with a `build_profile`
records the Run, you upload the artifacts, then `runs.complete_build` finalizes the Run. This
page is the recipe for shaping those artifacts so they pass validation on the first try.

The validator rejects a malformed upload with a precise message, but only **after** the
upload round-trip — so the cost of getting the shape wrong is a wasted upload, not just an
error. Each rule below names the rejection it prevents.

## Choosing your kernel config

**The kernel config is yours to choose.** Because you build the kernel locally, you decide
which Kconfig symbols are enabled before you upload — a debug kernel is one you built with the
debug options turned on. The validator constrains only the artifacts' **structure** (bzImage
magic, gzip layout, a `lib/modules` member); it never rejects a build over your `.config`.
There is no allowed-config allowlist and no required-symbol gate: enable what the
investigation needs. One non-blocking exception: if you upload an `effective_config` that
provably lacks the symbols needed to mount the root filesystem and boot (`EXT4_FS` and
`VIRTIO_BLK` — root is `/dev/vda` ext4 on virtio-blk), `runs.complete_build` still succeeds but
returns a `data.missing_boot_config` advisory naming the missing symbols, so a kernel that
cannot boot is not silently accepted.

**Start from the catalog image's own config, not a bare `defconfig`.** When you build against a
catalog image, call `images.kernel_config(image_id)` (ADR-0317) and start from the `.config` it
returns — `refs.download_uri` presigns a short-lived GET of that image's known-good
`/boot/config-<ver>` (the version is in `data.default_kernel_version`). This is the recommended
starting point: a stock `defconfig` commonly builds `VIRTIO_BLK` and `EXT4_FS` as modules rather
than built-in, so the resulting kernel cannot mount the `/dev/vda` ext4 rootfs and never boots the
direct-kernel guest. Begin from the image's config, then layer on the debug symbols below.

A useful debug set to start from:

```
CONFIG_KASAN=y            # slab/stack out-of-bounds and use-after-free detector
CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE=y
CONFIG_KCSAN=y            # data-race detector
CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION=y  # failslab / fail_page_alloc via debugfs
CONFIG_FAILSLAB=y
CONFIG_FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF5=y  # DWARF/BTF: required for drgn to resolve any symbol (see below)
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y     # BTF: what in-guest drgn-live reads
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y    # lockdep
```

**`drgn` needs debuginfo to resolve any symbol.** For `drgn-live` introspection
(`introspect.run` / `introspect.script`), build with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`: in-guest drgn reads
BTF from `/sys/kernel/btf`, so a defconfig kernel without it resolves nothing. DWARF in the kernel
`.config` alone does not help drgn-live — the DWARF `vmlinux` is not on the guest rootfs. For
host-side DWARF introspection (offline `introspect.from_vmcore` and gdb), build with
`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF5=y` and also upload `vmlinux`. A drgn-live session or introspect over a
kernel with neither BTF nor an uploaded `vmlinux` returns a non-fatal `missing_debuginfo` warning.

**DWARF has a cost — omit it when you do not need post-boot introspection.**
`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF5=y` embeds DWARF tables in every `.ko`, which can grow the module tree
10-50x (tens of MiB to a couple of GiB) and slows both upload and install proportionally — the
worker decompresses and repacks the whole module tree. Enable it only for live drgn/gdb symbol
resolution or offline vmcore analysis. For a boot-time crash reproducer or any investigation whose
evidence is the serial-console log (an oops/panic before userspace), omit it. The
`artifacts.feature_config_requirements` `debuginfo` entry states the same when/cost tradeoff.
When you do build a DWARF-heavy kernel, an operator can point `KDIVE_INSTALL_SCRATCH` at a tmpfs
mount to keep the large, short-lived install intermediates off the staging disk (mind the RAM
tradeoff — see the config reference).

`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y` in the `.config` is necessary but not sufficient: BTF-only drgn-live
introspection also depends on the guest image's drgn build being able to load that BTF at runtime
(older in-guest drgn versions can fail to load a newer kernel's BTF). When the config advertises
BTF but the in-guest drgn cannot actually resolve symbols, `introspect.run` / `introspect.script`
return a non-fatal `debuginfo_unloadable` warning naming the likely cause; remediate by booting a
BTF-capable guest image with a newer drgn, or by uploading a matching `vmlinux`.
See `artifacts.feature_config_requirements` for the per-feature `CONFIG_*` manifest.

## The `kernel` artifact: one combined gzip tar

There is **one required artifact, named `kernel`**: a single gzip-compressed tar holding the
boot image and the matching module tree. There is no separate `modules` artifact — the module
tree rides inside the `kernel` tar.

The `boot/vmlinuz` payload format is keyed by the **target architecture** you declare in the
build profile (`arch`, default `x86_64`) at `runs.create`:

| `arch` | `boot/vmlinuz` is | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `x86_64` | the **bzImage** (`arch/x86/boot/bzImage`), renamed | must carry the bzImage `HdrS` magic at offset `0x202` — the `vmlinux` ELF is **not** accepted here |
| `ppc64le` | the **stripped ELF kernel** (powerpc has no bzImage — this is what Fedora/RHEL install as `/boot/vmlinuz-<ver>`) | must be a 64-bit little-endian ELF whose `e_machine` is `EM_PPC64`; the unstripped DWARF `vmlinux` belongs in the optional `vmlinux` artifact, not here |

The tar must also contain:

| Member | What it is | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/modules/<release>/…` | the `make modules_install` tree for that kernel | at least one real kernel-module file (`*.ko`, `.ko.xz`, `.ko.gz`, or `.ko.zst`) under `lib/modules/<release>/` must be present — a bare directory or a `modules.dep` with no module is rejected |

The declared `arch` and the payload must agree: an x86 bzImage under `arch: ppc64le`, or an ELF
(or non-ppc64 ELF) under `arch: x86_64`, is rejected. Learn the exact per-arch magic bytes from
`artifacts.expected_uploads` (`contracts.kernel.layout[boot/vmlinuz].formats_by_arch`).

Two further rules come from how the artifact is validated and consumed:

- **gzip specifically** — a plain `.tar`, `.tar.xz`, or `.tar.zst` is rejected
  (`kernel artifact is not a gzip-compressed combined tar`).
- **put `boot/vmlinuz` first** — validation scans at most the first 128 MiB of *decompressed*
  output (a gzip-bomb guard), so the `lib/modules` header must appear within that window. The
  boot image is small and listed first in the recipe below, so the module tree is reached
  immediately; a tar that front-loads a very large file before `lib/modules` can fail with
  `kernel combined tar has no lib/modules member within the scan bound`.
- **drop the back-reference symlinks** — `make modules_install` plants `build` and `source`
  symlinks under `lib/modules/<release>/` that point at absolute paths in your build tree.
  Exclude them; left in, they become dangling links inside the guest.

### Packaging speed: parallel gzip and command timeouts

A debug kernel plus its full module tree is large — typically hundreds of MiB to a few
GiB uncompressed — and single-threaded `gzip` (what `tar -czf` uses) can take several
minutes to compress an archive that size. Size the packaging step's command timeout for a
multi-minute, single-core compress; a short default timeout will expire mid-compress.

When `pigz` (parallel gzip) is installed, prefer it: it spreads the compression work across
cores and cuts wall-clock time roughly in proportion to core count. `pigz` emits a standard
gzip stream, so its output passes validation identically to `tar -czf` (same `\x1f\x8b`
magic at offset 0), and `tar` — not `pigz` — still controls member order, so the
"`boot/vmlinuz` first" rule above is preserved. If `pigz` is not installed, use the plain
`tar -czf` form unchanged. When compression time dominates, `pigz -1` (or `gzip -1`) trades
ratio for speed.

### The recipe (x86_64)

This is the exact `tar` invocation the platform's own build planes use. Run it from a built
kernel tree, with `MODROOT` pointing at the staging root you passed to
`make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=…`:

```bash
KBUILD=.                 # the built kernel tree (contains arch/x86/boot/bzImage)
MODROOT=/tmp/modstage    # INSTALL_MOD_PATH from `make modules_install` (holds lib/modules/<release>)

tar -czf kernel.tar.gz \
  --exclude='*/build' --exclude='*/source' \
  --transform='s|^arch/x86/boot/bzImage$|boot/vmlinuz|' \
  -C "$KBUILD"  arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
  -C "$MODROOT" lib/modules
```

`--transform` renames the bzImage to `boot/vmlinuz` in the archive; the two `--exclude`s drop
the back-reference symlinks; listing `arch/x86/boot/bzImage` before `lib/modules` keeps the
boot image first.

When `pigz` is available, swap the compressor to parallelize the compress — same members,
same order, valid gzip:

```bash
tar -I "pigz -p $(nproc)" -cf kernel.tar.gz \
  --exclude='*/build' --exclude='*/source' \
  --transform='s|^arch/x86/boot/bzImage$|boot/vmlinuz|' \
  -C "$KBUILD"  arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
  -C "$MODROOT" lib/modules
```

### The recipe (ppc64le)

powerpc has no bzImage — the boot member is the **stripped** ELF kernel. Strip the build-tree
`vmlinux` first (the unstripped one carries full DWARF and is hundreds of MB, which pushes
`lib/modules` past the validator's decompress scan bound), then tar the stripped copy:

```bash
KBUILD=.                 # the built kernel tree (contains the top-level vmlinux)
MODROOT=/tmp/modstage    # INSTALL_MOD_PATH from `make modules_install`

"${CROSS_COMPILE}strip" -s "$KBUILD/vmlinux" -o /tmp/vmlinuz   # stripped, bootable, tens of MB

tar -czf kernel.tar.gz \
  --exclude='*/build' --exclude='*/source' \
  --transform='s|^vmlinuz$|boot/vmlinuz|' \
  -C /tmp        vmlinuz \
  -C "$MODROOT"  lib/modules
```

Declare `arch: ppc64le` in the build profile at `runs.create`. The unstripped DWARF `vmlinux`
goes in the optional `vmlinux` artifact (below), not the boot member.

When `pigz` is available, swap the compressor to parallelize the compress — same members,
same order, valid gzip:

```bash
tar -I "pigz -p $(nproc)" -cf kernel.tar.gz \
  --exclude='*/build' --exclude='*/source' \
  --transform='s|^vmlinuz$|boot/vmlinuz|' \
  -C /tmp        vmlinuz \
  -C "$MODROOT"  lib/modules
```

### Verify the layout before uploading

Compression and upload are the slow steps, so catch a layout mistake here rather than after a
full compress-and-upload round-trip that `runs.complete_build` would then reject. List the
archive and confirm `boot/vmlinuz` is the **first** member with the module tree following:

```bash
tar -tzf kernel.tar.gz | head    # boot/vmlinuz must be first; lib/modules/<release>/… follows
```

## Optional artifacts

| Name | When to upload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `vmlinux` | to enable kernel-debugging / DWARF introspection | the uncompressed kernel ELF with debug info. If you upload it you **must** declare a `build_id` in `runs.complete_build`, and it must match the ELF's GNU build-id note, or the upload is rejected. |
| `effective_config` | to record the `.config` you built with | the kernel `.config` used for the build, ≤ 1 MiB. Stored for provenance; never rejected, but if it provably lacks the boot-required symbols (`EXT4_FS`, `VIRTIO_BLK`) `runs.complete_build` returns a non-blocking `missing_boot_config` advisory. |
| `initrd` | when booting needs a specific initramfs | the initial ramdisk image. |

## The upload flow

1. `artifacts.expected_uploads` — confirm the accepted names for the `run` owner-kind.
2. Build `kernel.tar.gz` with the recipe above (plus any optional artifacts).
3. `artifacts.create_run_upload` — declare each artifact `{name, sha256 (base64), size_bytes}`
   and receive one upload item per artifact. Each item contains `refs.upload_url` and
   `data.required_headers`; objects over the single-PUT limit can be declared with `chunks`.
4. PUT each object to its presigned URL, sending **exactly** the headers in
   `data.required_headers` and nothing else.
5. `runs.complete_build` — finalize. The server validates every uploaded object (shape, magic,
   manifest `sha256`/`size_bytes`, and the `vmlinux` build-id) before the Run becomes
   installable.

Each `artifacts.create_run_upload` call replaces the previous manifest for the Run. If you
correct one artifact, redeclare every artifact that should remain part of the build.

### Pitfall: extra headers break the signature

The presigned URL is signed over a fixed header set. If your HTTP client injects a header
that isn't in `data.required_headers` — most commonly a default `Content-Type` — the PUT
fails with `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch`. `curl -d`/`--data-binary` is a common trap: it adds
`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and can mangle binary bodies. Use `curl -T`
to upload the file, and explicitly clear `Content-Type` since it is never one of the
`required_headers`:

```bash
curl -T kernel.tar.gz -H 'Content-Type:' \
  -H 'x-amz-checksum-sha256: <b64>' -H 'x-amz-meta-sensitivity: sensitive' \
  -H 'x-amz-meta-retention-class: build' "$UPLOAD_URL"
```

Replace the `x-amz-*` headers above with the exact set from `data.required_headers` for that
upload item — the names and values are per-artifact.

A mismatch between a declared `sha256`/`size_bytes` and the stored object is rejected
(`uploaded artifact disagrees with its manifest`), so checksum the bytes you actually PUT. If
you bypassed the presigned PUT with a direct `put_object` (no `x-amz-checksum-sha256`), the
object has no stored checksum and finalize rejects it distinctly (`uploaded artifact has no
stored SHA-256 checksum …`) — upload through the signed URL so the checksum is bound.
